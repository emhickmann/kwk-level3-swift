# Collaboration and Working Styles (35 min)

## Introverts, Extroverts, and Everything In Between

There are no slides for this session. You can do this as a more informal setting and either use the white board or use chart paper.  You should plan to have chart paper and markers for the discussion.

Session Structure:
* Opening: objectives, reading (9 mins)
* Line Up (5 mins)
* Small Group Discussion #1 (15 mins)
* Closing (5 min)

### Opening (2 min)
You have started to work together in meaningful ways--during class, in pairing sessions, and in partner projects.  That means that we are 100% certain you are about to experience (or already have) a clash in working styles. By discussing how we learn and work best, we can become more aware of these preferences, think about ways that we can better communicate our needs, and compromise in order to bring out the best in everyone.

#### Objectives (2 min)

* Build self-awareness so that you can develop even more empathy with others
* Understand how we can leverage our different working styles for success at KWK and beyond

#### What Do Introversion and Extroversion Mean, Really? (5 min)
What comes to mind when you hear the word "introvert"? What comes to mind when you hear the word "extrovert"? What impressions do you already have about these terms? 

Read the following [article](https://www.fastcompany.com/3016031/leadership-now/are-you-an-introvert-or-an-extrovert-and-what-it-means-for-your-career) to get a better sense of what these terms mean.
* If you do not have time, you can summarize the article "Introverts gain energy from being alone, extroverts gain energy from being with other, ambiverts need both *

Often we think that introverts are shy and extroverts are outgoing. But in reality, everyone exists on the spectrum of introversion and extroversion, and our place on that spectrum can change depending on our current circumstances.

### Working Styles & Preferences at Turing (5 min)
On the imaginary line, think about where you fall in the spectrum of introversion and extroversion while at KWK. Many times you can say that your intro/extro/ambiversion might depend on the situation. In this case, we want you to select the place on the spectrum that you are most often in while you are at camp.   

### Small Group Discussion #1 (10 min)
With 2-3 people who are standing near you on the line, form a group and grab a piece of chart paper to answer the following questions:

* What does this place on the spectrum mean to you? What does this place on the spectrum look like in practice at camp?
* What are your strengths in regards to this working style?
* What challenges have you faced because you identify with this working style? Think about challenges working with others.
* How do you think you're perceived by those who don't share this same working style?
* What do you need from other working styles to be at your best?

Each group should be ready to share their chart

### Closing (5 min)

Have each group share their chart.  Highlight the strengths and benefits of working with people across the spectrum.  If there is time, consider having students think about how they could leverage each other's strengths during this camp.
